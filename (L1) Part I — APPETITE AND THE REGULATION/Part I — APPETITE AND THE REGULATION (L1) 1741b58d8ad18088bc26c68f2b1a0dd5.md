        1. Maintenance of nearly constant conditions in the internal environment
        2. All organs and tissues of the body perform functions that help maintain these constant conditions
            
            ***e.g.***
            
            - Lungs provide O$_2$ to ECF for replenishment of those used by cells

        **Blood circulation in body**
        
        **Stage**
        
        Extracellular fluid is transported through body in **2 stages**:
        
        1. Movement of blood in blood vessels
        2. Movement of fluid between the blood capillaries and intracellular spaces between the tissue cells.
        
        **Speed**
        
        All blood in circulation traverse the entire circulatory circuit at an average of
        
        - **1 time per min** (at rest)
        - ~**‚â• 6 times per min** (extremely active)
        
        **Exchange of materials between plasma and interstitial fluid**
        
        1. As blood passes through capillaries, **continual** exchange of ECF occurs between plasma and interstitial fluid simultaneously
        2. Walls of capillaries are **permeable** to most molecules in plasma, except large plasma proteins and blood cells
        3. Large amounts of fluid and dissolved constituents diffuse **back and forth** between blood and tissue spaces
        4. Fluid and dissolved molecules are continually moving and bouncing in **all directions** within plasma and interstitial fluid + through capillary pores

        **Respiratory system**
        
        When blood passes through **lungs**, O$_2$ is picked up in the **alveoli**

        **GI tract, liver and metabolic organs**
        
        1. **GI tract**: Dissolved nutrients (carbohydrates, fatty acids and amino acids) are absorbed from ingested food into plasma
        2. **Liver** changes chemical compositions of most absorbed nutrients to more usable forms (for itself) and other tissues
        
        ![image.png](image%206.png)
        
        **Musculoskeletal system**

        1. Simultaneously when blood picks up O$_2$, CO$_2$ is released from blood into alveoli
        2. CO$_2$ is the most abundant end products of metabolism
        
        ![image.png](image%208.png)
        
        **Kidneys**
        
        1. Remove most substances besides CO$_2$ including urea, excess ions and water from food
        2. Most of these substances are **POORLY reabsorbed** and pass through renal tubules into urine

        ![image.png](image%2013.png)
        
        Most control systems of the body act by `-ve` feedback 
        
        ***e.g.***  **CO$_2$ conc. in ECF**
        
        1. High conc. CO$_2$ in ECF ‚áí ‚¨ÜÔ∏è pulmonary ventilation
        2. Lungs expire greater amounts of CO$_2$ from body ‚áí üîªconc. CO$_2$ in ECF
        3. High conc. CO$_2$ in ECF initiates events that üîªconc. towards normal, which is NEGATIVE/OPPOSITE to the initiating stimulus
        4. Conversely, if conc. CO$_2$ too low ‚áí feedback to ‚¨ÜÔ∏è the concentration (also negative to initiating stimulus)
        
        In general, if some factor becomes excessive or deficient, control system initiates `-ve` feedback: a series of changes that return the factor toward a certain mean value, thus **maintaining homeostasis**

    - 5.2 **Positive feedback** can sometimes cause vicious cycles and even death
        
        **Q:** Why do essentially all control systems of the body operate by **negative** feedback rather than positive feedback?
        
        **A:** `+ve` feedback ‚ùå lead to stability but to instability and often death
        
        **Severe Condition** ‚Äî **2L blood loss** ü©∏ (*fig*)

        ‚áí Further üîª pumping 
        ‚áí **Vicious cycle** repeats until death
        
        ***Note:*** each cycle in the feedback results in further weakening of heart, in other words, the initiating stimulus causes more of the same, which is a positive feedback.

        In some instances, the body use positive feedback to its advantage.
        
        ***e.g.* Blood clotting**
        
        - When blood vessel ruptured and clot begins to form, multiple enzymes (**clotting factors**) activated within the clot
        - Some of these enzymes act on other un-activated enzymes of immediately adjacent blood  ‚áí more blood clotting

        - The means by which different parts of the body operate in harmony
        1. The body is a social order of **~100 trillion cells** organized into different functional structures, some of which are called organs
        2. Each functional structure contributes to the maintain homeostatic conditions in ECF (the internal environment)
        3. When normal conditions are maintained, cells of the body continue to live and function properly
        4. Each cell benefits from homeostasis and contributes toward maintenance of homeostasis
        5. This **reciprocal interplay** provides continuous automaticity of body until ‚â• 1 functional systems lose their ability to contribute to this stability
        6. When this happens, all cells of the body suffer:

        1. Body maintains a set point for weight and fat mass, known as adiposity, by regulating food intake and energy expenditure

            - Resting energy expenditure (basal metabolic rate)

        2. Includes sleeping & arousal-related energy expenditure
        3. Determined by age (old lower), sex (male higher), body composition (muscle higher) & genetic traits
        4. Fat-free mass is the strongest predictor of resting metabolic rate
        5. ~5% of the BMR is utilised to maintain arousal
        6. Environmental and internal body temperature also affect BMR

        Thermogenic effect of food
        
        1. 8-10% of total energy consumed is used to process food (produce enzymes; movement of GI tract)
        2. Varies based on food consumption ‚Äî
        carbohydrate 5-10%, fat 0-3%, protein 20-30%
        
        Physical activity-induced energy expenditure
        
        - Most variable component of energy expenditure ‚Äî varies from 15% (very sedentary) to 50% (highly active)
        - Combines energy expenditure from **(i)** voluntary exercise and **(ii)** spontaneous activity, including non-exercise activity thermogenesis (**NEAT**) *e.g.* walking
        - NEAT is proportionate to spontaneous activity (fidgeting), which is likely regulated by orexin **È£üÊÖæÁ¥†** (neuropeptide that regulates arousal, wakefulness and appetite) via action in hypothalamus
            - Higher NEAT, lesser risk of weight gain

        1. The first line of therapy for weight management ‚Äî lifestyle change and behavior modification which may involve cognitive behavioral therapy
        2. It is also important:
            - To identify the **adverse risk factor*** contributing to change in weight or appetite
            - To consider patients‚Äô food preferences, cultural influences, resources for healthy food procuring and whether a food reward mechanism (**addiction**) is involved
        3. Interrogating a person‚Äôs daily routine and dietary habits gives clues to weight gain risk factors, including food choice, physical activity, psychosocial stressors, work environment and sleep pattern
        4. Patients can benefit from a referral to a dietitian for nutritional counselling and/or a psychologist for cognitive behavioral therapy for behavioral change.
        5. The pharmacotherapy for weight management is based on our understanding on physiology of energy balance
        6. Surgical options will only be made available when lifestyle modification and pharmacotherapy fail to achieve desired weight loss
